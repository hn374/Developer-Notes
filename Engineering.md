# Software Engineering Principles

***

## Waterfall Development

In waterfall development, the entire product is planned, then the entire product is developed, then the entire product is tested.

## Agile Scrum Development

In Agile Scrum, a small portion of work is designed, then it is developed, and then it is tested. This process is repeated until the product is finished. This generally means QA is involved a lot earlier on in the development life cycle and that often results in a better product. Tasks are divided into stories, and a time period defined as a sprint is when you accomplish several stories. 

You will also usually have meetings before a sprint starts to plan for the next sprint by picking out which stories to work on from the product backlog. There will also be meetings after a sprint is done to discuss how the sprints went and what could be improved. Generally, teams should not make any changes during a sprint.

Scrum has three clearly defined roles, the product owners, the scrum master and the development team.

## Agile Kanban Development

In Agile Kanban, instead of having two week sprints, development is continuous. There are no roles. Changes can also happen any time. Releases also happen continuously.

## Scrums/Stand-Ups

Daily meetings where the team discusses their progress and anything that is blocking them from doing their duties.
