# Think Like A Programmer

## Introduction

Learning programming syntax, reading programs, memorizing elements of an API, these are mostly analytical left brain activities.

Writing an original program using previously learned tools and skills is a creative right brain activity.

A great cook understands ingredients, preparation methods, and cooking methods and knows how they can be combined to make great meals. All a cook needs to produce a tasy meal is a fully stocked ktichen.

In the same way, a great programmer understands language syntax, application frameworks, algorithms, and software engineering principles and knows how they can be combined to make great programs.

In general, current programming education doesn't offer much guidance in the area of problem solving.

You can learn problem solving in a systematic way. You can learn techniques to organize your thoughts, procedures to discover solutions and strategies to apply to certain classes of problems. By studying these approaches, you can unlock your creativity.

## Chapter 1

Problems include constraints, unbreakable rules about the problem or the way in which the problem must be solved.

For programmers, we can define problem solving as writing an original program that performs a particular set of tasks and meets all stated constraints.

Expert problem solvers are quick to recognize an analogy, an exploitable similarity between a solved problem and an unsolved problem. If we recognize that a feature of problem A is analogous to a feature of problem B and we have already solved problem B, we have a valuable insight into solving problem A.

If you are unaware of all possible actions you could take, you may be unable to solve the problem.

Restating the problem in a more formal manner is a great technique for gaining insight into a problem.

Many programmers seek out other programmers to discuss a problem, not justb ecause other programmers may have the answer but also because articulating the problem out loud often triggers new and useful thoughts. Restating a problem is like having that discussion with another programmer, except that you are playing both parts.

The broader lesson is that thinking about the problem may be as productive, or in some cases more productive than thinking about the solution.
