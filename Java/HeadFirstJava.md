# Java

## Chapter 1: Introduction

Every Java application has to have at least one class and one main method.

The main() method is where you code starts running.

## Chapter 2: Classes and Objects

A class is a blueprint for the object. 

A real Java application is nothing but objects talking to other objects.

Each time an object is created in Java, it goes into an area of memory known as The Heap. Java manages memory for you. When the JVM sees that the object can't be used anymore, it is eligible for garbage collection.

The garbage collector will run, throw out the unreachable objects, and free up space so that space can be used later.

Marking something as public and static makes it behave like a global variable.
